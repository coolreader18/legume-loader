## Changing Code
Fork this project, `clone` it to your computer, and change whatever you'd like to. Make sure that it works with the website in 
the test directory (just serve it and look at the console output), and add something there if you want. If you're using atom and
have atom-build, simply build the file, otherwise just run the command that's in .atom-build.yml. Create a pull request, describe
what you've changed, submit.

## Creating an Issue
I dunno, if you find an issue, submit it. I'm sure I'll have better guidelines later.
