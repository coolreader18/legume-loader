## Changing Code
Fork this project, `clone` it to your computer, and change whatever you'd like to. If you're using atom and have atom-build, simply build the file, otherwise just run the command that's in .atom-build.yml. Create a pull request, describe what you've changed, submit.

## Creating an Issue
I dunno, if you find an issue, submit it. I'm sure I'll have better guidelines later.
