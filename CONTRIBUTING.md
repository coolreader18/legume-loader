## Changing Code

Fork this project, `clone` it to your computer, and change whatever you'd like to. Make sure that it works with the website in
the test directory (just serve it and look at the console output), and add something there if you want.
Run `yarn build` or `npm build`. Create a pull request, describe
what you've changed, submit.

## Creating an Issue

I dunno, if you find an issue, submit it. I'm sure I'll have better guidelines later.
